Ok now, I think we should move on the next phase of in our project. As you notice in the client application, we have only managed to
implement functions and features for "login", "logout" and "post" commands, we haven't implemented anything to do with "news", "list" 
and "delete" commands which are required according to the project specification. 

Also according to the project specification, "Once you have implemented your news service, you should register yourself to this directory
using the directoryâ€™s /api/register service.", I don't really understand what this means, or I am not even sure we are at the stage where 
we could say that we have implemented our news service. For this I need guidance from you, as the project specification is not clear to me 
on how to achieve this.

Also my question is what stage are we at in the project? Are we halfway through this task "WP2: implement the web API of your agency, one 
service at time, and in parallel write the client application code to request services, and test each service as you go." Please study the 
project specification again so that you can provide me with advice to the best of your ability.

"""
So my question is do I need to register with a directory service or do I need to implement "news", "list", and "delete" commands for my 
client application first?
